# Gamified Habit Tracker

## Project Description
The **Gamified Habit Tracker** is a backend service that allows users to set and track their daily goals. It integrates gamification mechanics, where users can earn points for completing habits, maintain streaks for consistency, and level up based on their performance. The application also features a real-time leaderboard, encouraging a competitive edge among users.

The goal of this project is to help users build better habits in a fun and engaging way by applying game-like principles to daily activities.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in to their accounts.
- **Habit Creation and Management:** Users can create, update, and delete habits.
- **Gamification Mechanics:**
  - Points awarded for completing habits.
  - Streaks for maintaining consecutive days of habit completion.
  - Leveling up based on accumulated points.
- **Leaderboard:** Displays the top users based on their total points.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Leaderboard and streaks are updated in real-time.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
- **Database:**
  - MongoDB (for user and habit data)
- **Caching:**
  - Redis (for real-time leaderboard updates)
- **Authentication:**
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
- **Other:**
  - bcrypt.js (for password hashing)
  - Mongoose (for MongoDB schema management)
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or an [Atlas MongoDB Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) instance)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gamified-habit-tracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gamified-habit-tracker
   ```

3. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables to the `.env` file:
     ```bash
     PORT=5000
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gamified-habit-tracker  # For local MongoDB
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # For local Redis instance
     ```

5. Start your MongoDB and Redis services (if running locally).

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it via API clients like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

- **Sign Up** to create a new user account.
- **Log In** to receive a JWT token, which you will use for subsequent authenticated requests.
- **Create Habits** and manage your progress.
- **Track your streaks and points** as you complete habits daily.
- **Check the leaderboard** to see your rank among other users.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST /api/users/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/users/login**: Log in and receive a JWT token.

### Habit Management
- **GET /api/habits**: Get all habits for the authenticated user.
- **POST /api/habits**: Create a new habit.
- **PUT /api/habits/:id**: Update a habit.
- **DELETE /api/habits/:id**: Delete a habit.

### Gamification
- **POST /api/habits/:id/complete**: Mark a habit as completed for the day.
- **GET /api/leaderboard**: Get the top users based on points.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file:

| Variable     | Description                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `PORT`       | The port your server will run on (default 5000) |
| `MONGO_URI`  | Your MongoDB connection string             |
| `JWT_SECRET` | A secret key for signing JWT tokens        |
| `REDIS_URL`  | The URL of your Redis instance             |

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, several challenges were faced, including:
- Managing real-time leaderboard updates using Redis.
- Securing user authentication with JWT.
- Implementing gamification mechanics in a scalable way.

Learnings included how to effectively use caching with Redis, building REST APIs with Express, and working with MongoDB’s Mongoose for data modeling.

## Future Improvements
- **Frontend Interface:** Build a frontend interface with React or Angular to provide a more interactive user experience.
- **Push Notifications:** Add push notifications to remind users to complete their daily habits.
- **Social Features:** Allow users to connect with friends, share habits, and compete in group challenges.
